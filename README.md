Library Management System
About
Our project is a library management system developed in C++ using data structures.

Data Structures Used
QUEUE,BST,FILE,HASH,LINKED LIST

Description
As we have to know some type of ID (numbers) to store data in BST. So we generated book IDs using book names. In that algorithm we used queues.
We have used hashing using a 2D array of 10 x 5 (10 rows and 5 columns) of BST. The 5 columns are the racks.
our every node in BST contains a linked list.
